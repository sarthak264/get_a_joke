# Get a Joke

This is a very simple joke telling app compared to my last project in react native, the goal was to make a simple app that consumes an API.

## Features

It has the following features:

- When opened app automatically generates a joke for you.
- When clicked on the button it gets a new joke.

## My learnings

- How to use async programming to consume api in a react native app.
- How to use custom fonts in a react native app.
- Used libraries like axios.

## API used

A small shoutout to [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ 'https://icanhazdadjoke.com/') for making such an awesome API and then providing it to anyone for absolutely free.
